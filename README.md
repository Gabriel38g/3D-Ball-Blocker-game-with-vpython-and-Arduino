# 3D-Ball-Blocker-game-with-vpython-and-Arduino
This Code is 'Final Exam' for Paul McWhorter's Course on using Arduino with Python
Par of the course was to create a 3D version of a Pong-type game with a moing ball and some kind of paddle or blocker controlled by the user
The 'Final Exam' was to add or contribute something of your own to whatever other projects that were learned in the course. I chose to put the joystick
control function of the game in its own thread to try to improve the game performance and make it more playable.

This code requires an Arduino Uno connected to the computer. (Interaction between Arduino and Python is needed to control the game.)
A joystick controller is connected to the Arduino 5v, A0, A1, D2, and GND
It also requires that Python3 and vpython are installed on your computer.
The python code must be changed to the port of your Arduino (e.g COM1 or ACMO, etc)

A demonstration of this code is here on my YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/ssaVfeHOa-U
